# Digitization and Recording of Speech

In this project we have used **SpeechRecognition** package and a **Recognizer class**.

We have used **record** function. "record" function captures data from a file. The context manager opens the file and reads its contents, storing the data in an audio file instance called "source", then the "record" method records the data from the entire file into an audio data instance.
