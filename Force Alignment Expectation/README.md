# Force Alignment Expectation

In this we have tried to generate a transcript and examine whats its expectation.

We have used **Histogram** to analyse the given data.

We have made an observation that some samples belong to Group A and some to Group B (see figure in the notebook) but some are difficult to separate.

We have used **sympy** which is a library to create a variable symbolically and give us output compatible with numpy.

We have minimized the expectation and calculated the expectation steps.

We have plotted the **Incomplete Likelihood**.
