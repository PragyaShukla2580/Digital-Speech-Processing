# Analysis of Audio Files
<ul>
  <li>In this file, we have used a python module, called **librosa**, which is used to analyze audio signals.</li>
  <li>Then we have visualized this audio by importing **librosa.display** package.</li>
  <li>We have also visualized the spectrum using **stft** function which converts data into a short term fourier transform. It is used to convert signals such that we can determine the amplitude of a given frequency at a given time.</li>
  <li>We have used **specshow** function to display the spectrogram.</li>
