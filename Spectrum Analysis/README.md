# Spectrum Analysis

In this project, we have generated a **frequency chirp signal**, that tells how the power spectral density looks like.

We have also plotted the **Spectrum** of the given signal.

Then we have computed and plotted the **Spectrogram**, the spectrum of the signal on consecutive time windows.

Next, we have computed and plotted the **power spectral density (PSD)**, the power of the signal per frequency band.
