# Audio Signal Feature Extraction

In this notebook, we have used **PyAudio** package to listen the audio file. It gives start and end button.

We have plotted the Signal(Waveform) which gives a plot between amplitude vs time domain.

Then we have displayed the **Spectrogram** and have determined in amplitude vs frequency domain. **stft** is Short-Time Fourier Transform which transforms from Time domain to Frequency domain.

Then we have zoomed in and found the **Zero Crossing Rate** (at what rate is it crossing the signal from positive to negative).

We have also plotted the **Spectral Centroid** i.e Centre of Mass (Weighted mean of the frequencies present in the sound).

We have visualized the **Spectral RollOff** and found the **MFCC - Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients**.
