# Building a Basic Language Model

In this project we have built a **basic language model** using trigrams of the **Reuters corpus**. 

Reuters corpus is a collection of 10,788 news documents totalling 1.3 million words. 

A language model can be built using a few lines of code using **NLTK package**. 

NLTK: Natural Language Tool Kit, an open source python package for doing NLP in python.

Bigrams and trigrams are basic building blocks of natural language processing. For NLP, we use a collection of documents to train our models.

We have written a script to generate a random piece of text using our n-gram model.
